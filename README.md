# Fish Info 2
Vanilla World of Warcraft Fishing Addon 

# Functions
For every zone, it stores what fishes you caught there. It is basically a remake of 'Impp's Fishing Info'.

# How to access it
* Enter <code>/fi2</code> or <code>/fishinfo2</code> command in the chat.
* Assign a key to toggle display.
* Via Titan Panel, enable the Fish Info 2 button. If you click the button it will show all fishes you caught in the current subzone. Click again to hide the window. 

Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or the Close button to hide the window. You can move the window. 

Please note: if you enter a subzone (minimap text changes) and you open the window for the first time in this subzone, the script preselect the current zone/subzone for you. If you don't like this, use "/fi nopreselect" chat command to open the window.

# How to use it
First, go catch some fish :) . At first startup there is nothing in the database.

It has two modes:
* Select a zone and a subzone from the dropdown lists labeled with (Sub)Zone. It contains all zones/subzones where you were gone fishing. The script list then all fishes you caught in that subzone. The list is sorted by fish name.
* Enter a fish name in the editbox labeled with Name and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The script list then all zones in which you caught that fish. The list is sorted by zone name. Prefix a fish name with % to sort the result list by percentage. 

Hint: leave blank and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to list all fish. Just write a % and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> so see all fish sorted by percentage.

The icons in the result list have two number overlays:
* top right: how often you caught the fish in this subzone.
* bottom: percentage for this subzone.
